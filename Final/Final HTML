   <p class="paragraph">
    Cape Leveque - the whole Dampier Peninsula is still an untouched wilderness, surrounded by an amazing coastline and untainted by the usual mass tourism ventures. Instead there are several Aboriginal communities that welcome interested visitors and offer accommodation, cultural tours, fishing and a glimpse into their traditional lifestyle. They are happy to share their knowledge about bush foods and medicines, traditional hunting and fishing techniques and their special relationship with their land and the ocean.
